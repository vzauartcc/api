    Hello {{name}},<br><br>
    On behalf of the Chicago vARTCC, we're happy to have you join our team! By choosing ZAU, you have selected a very busy region on VATSIM and one that prides itself always striving for excellence.<br><br>
    First, please login to ZAU's website, easily located at <a href="https://www.zauartcc.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.zauartcc.org</a>! This is required! If you encounter an issue with this, please email <a href="mailto:datm@zauartcc.org">datm@zauartcc.org</a> with your CID and the issue you are encountering.<br><br>
    All new controllers to our community should read through the documents on the website, especially Training Order 3120.4B. This will help familiarize yourself with Chicago vARTCC procedures, including the training flow required to get certified.<br><br>
    You will be certified on all minor facilities up to and including your current rating, though this is contingent on completion of the exams needed for each rating. The MDW_GND exam is self-enroll on the VATUSA Academy website under the Chicago ARTCC course. After completion of this exam, you will be required to complete test corrections on all missed questions. An instructor will then assign you the next exam, if needed.<br><br>
    Our goal is to help everyone have the best experience possible while participating in this pastime. This means independent work is an absolute necessity. The value of your own reading of materials, your own observation of other controllers and practice cannot be overstated.<br><br>
    Please join the ZAU Community Discord using this link: <a href="https://discord.gg/jBHkYGT9bP" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://discord.gg/jBHkYGT9bP</a>. This will be the place for you to ask questions and get to know everyone!<br><br>
    We look forward to working with you and hope you will find your experience as a ZAU controller to be an enjoyable one! Please let us know if you have any questions and join us in our Discord to meet us and join the community!<br><br>
    On behalf of our entire team, we look forward to seeing you!<br><br>
    Sincerely,<br>
    ZAU Staff<br><br>
